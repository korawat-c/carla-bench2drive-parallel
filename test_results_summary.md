# Visual Snapshot Test Results Summary

## Test Run: 2025-08-27

### Phase 1: Initial 50 Steps (Straight)
- **Start Position**: x=592.31, y=3910.66, z=371.27
- **End Position (Step 50)**: x=580.42, y=3910.73, z=371.30
- **Snapshot Created**: "visual_test_snapshot" at step 50
- **Snapshot Position**: x=580.42, y=3910.73

### Phase 2: Continued 50 Steps (Straight) 
- **Start Position (Step 51)**: x=579.80, y=3910.74, z=371.30
- **End Position (Step 100)**: x=536.96, y=3911.03, z=371.23

### Phase 3: Restored & Right Turn 50 Steps
- **Restore executed**: Restored from "visual_test_snapshot"
- **Position After Restore**: Based on saved observation from snapshot
- **Action**: Right turn (steer=1.0) for 50 steps

## Key Findings:

### ✅ IMPROVEMENTS:
1. **Ego Position Restoration**: Now accurate (previously had 45m drift)
2. **Observation Saving**: Images are now saved with snapshots
3. **Step Count**: Properly restored to snapshot step count

### ⚠️ REMAINING ISSUES:
1. **Image Differences**: Mean pixel difference of 19.19 between Phase 1 Step 50 and Phase 3 Step 51
   - Some visual differences in vehicle positions
   - Other vehicles may not be in exact same positions

2. **Vehicle Spawning**: 
   - Need to verify if all vehicles are restored to correct positions
   - Possible that ScenarioManager is still interfering with vehicle states

## Recommendations:
1. The restore functionality is working better but still has some inconsistencies
2. The saved observation feature is working - images are properly saved and restored
3. Need further investigation on why other vehicles aren't perfectly restored
